            <h2>Some Thoughts</h2>
            <p id="descList">
                Starting from my 5th semester, I decided to make a list of topics, thought experiments, methods, and theorems that excite me the most. They make me want to think about them, talk about them, and learn more. Although they are not limited to my fields, most of them are. You can see the list below.
            </p>
